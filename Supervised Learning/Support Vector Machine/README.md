Support Vector Machine
---

Support Vector Machines are probably one of the most popular and talked about machine learning algorithms.

A hyperplane is a line that divides the input variable space. In SVM, the hyperplane is chosen to optimally separate points in the input variable space from their class (class 0 or class 1). In 2D, you can think of it as a line and assume that all our input points can be completely separated by this line. The SVM learning algorithm finds the coefficients that cause the hyperplane to best separate the classes.

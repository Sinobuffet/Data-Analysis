### [***Supervised learning***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning#:~:text=Supervised%20learning%20(SL)%20is%20the,a%20set%20of%20training%20examples.)
> Supervised learning means that machine learning data is labeled, and these labels can include data categories, data attributes, and feature point locations. These markers serve as an expected effect, continually revising the machine's predictions.
> 
> The specific implementation process is: train the machine through a large amount of labeled data, and the machine compares the predicted results with the expected results; then modifies the parameters in the model according to the comparison results, and outputs the predicted results again; then compare the predicted results with The expected results are compared, repeated many times until convergence, and finally a model with a certain robustness is generated to achieve the ability of intelligent decision-making. 

Common supervised learning is classification and regression:
* **Classification** is to classify some instance data into appropriate categories, and its prediction results are discrete.  
* **Regression** is to put data on a "line", that is, to produce a fitted curve for discrete data, so its prediction results are continuous.  

This project will main demonstrate the following supervised learning algorithm:
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets
* Support Vector Machines
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision/ Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning

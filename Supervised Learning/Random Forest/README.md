Random forest belongs to the Bagging (short for Bootstrap AGgregation) method in ensemble learning

Before explaining random forests, we need to mention decision trees. Decision tree is a very simple algorithm, which is highly explanatory and conforms to the intuitive thinking of human beings. This is a supervised learning algorithm based on if-then-else rules.

The decision tree algorithm adopts a tree structure and uses layer-by-layer reasoning to achieve the final classification. A decision tree consists of the following elements

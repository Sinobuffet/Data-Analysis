> Unsupervised learning means that the data for machine learning is unlabeled. Machines explore and infer potential connections from unlabeled data.

Common unsupervised learning is clustering and dimensionality reduction.


* **Clustering** , since the data category is not known in advance, the distribution of data samples in the feature space can only be analyzed, such as based on density or statistical probability model, so as to separate different data and separate similar data. grouped together.
* **Dimensionality Reduction** is to reduce the dimension of data. For example, to describe a watermelon, if only 6 attributes of skin color, root base, knock sound, texture, size, and sugar content are considered, these 6 attributes represent the dimension of watermelon data is 6. Further considering the work of dimensionality reduction, since the data itself has a huge number and various attribute characteristics, if all data information is analyzed, it will increase the burden of training and storage space. Therefore, other methods such as principal component analysis can be used to consider the main influencing factors and discard the secondary factors, so as to balance the accuracy and efficiency.

This project will demonstrate the following supervised learning algorithm:
* k-Means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis

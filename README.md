Idea of machine learning is not complicated, it is just a simulation of human life and learning process. And in this whole process, the most critical thing is data. Any research on data-trained learning algorithms is machine learning, including many techniques that have been developed over the years, The most commonly used machine learning classification methods divide them into:

### Supervised learning

> Supervised learning is to know the relationship between the input and output results based on the existing data set, and then train to obtain an optimal model based on this known relationship.

> Supervised learning is commonly used in classification and regression. For example, mobile phones identify spam text messages, and e-mails identify spam emails, both by marking some historical text messages and historical emails as spam, training models on these marked data, and then acquiring new text messages or new emails. When , model matching is performed to identify whether this email is or not, which is the prediction of classification under supervised learning.

### Unsupervised learning

> The difference between unsupervised learning and supervised learning is that the selected sample data does not need to have target values. We do not need to analyze the impact of these data on certain results, but only analyze the inherent laws of these data.

> Unsupervised learning has two most commonly used scenarios, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### Reinforcement learning

> The main difference between reinforcement learning and other learning methods is that during reinforcement learning training, feedback from the environment and corresponding specific feedback values are required. It is not a classification task, and it is not how to distinguish fraudulent customers from normal customers in a financial anti-fraud scenario. Reinforcement learning is mainly to guide the training object how to make decisions at each step, and what actions to take to accomplish a specific purpose or maximize benefits.
